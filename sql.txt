Alter table student add primary key(id);
Alter table student add constraint uk unique(name);
Alter table student add constraint fk foreign key(id) reference employee(ename);
Alter table student modify name = sname;
Alter table student drop primary key;
Primary key----unique identity each row/record in db column can not have null value table can have only one primary key

Foreign key used for integrity or data
Order by  ---ase/dec sorting
Group by – sorting by default asecending order , group by often used aggrete function (count,max,min,sum,avg)
Select * from employee;
Select max(salary) from student;
Select * from employee limit 3/top3/row<=3;
-single
%all
Select * from employee where salary like ‘200%’; 	start with 200
Select * from employee where salary like ‘%200%’; 	 200 any position
Select * from employee where salary like ‘2_3%’; 	start 2 end 3
Select * from employee where salary like ‘_2%3’; 	second  2 & last 3
Delete from employee    -- all record delete
Delete from employee where id=7;       --where  clause to filter the record

Auto increment must be key
Create table employee(id int auto increment, Date date, primary key(id));
Insert employee values(null,’2018-06-18’);
Select * from employee where id in(select id from employee where salary>1600);
Create table emp select * from employee;
Insert table emp select * from employee    --copy table
Create temporary table temp(int id);
Temporary table not show by  show tables command, table store data temporary, data used in webpage, when you close db connection then those table data will be automatically deleted.

Select  curdate();      Select  curtime();
Select name from employee where exists (select name from employee where name =’rohan’);

1) Inner Join
Both common
Syntax :- select column_name from table 1 inner join table 2 on table1.column=table2.column
Select student.id, student.name, student.city, student.age from student inner join stud where student.id= stud.sid;
2) Left join
Left all
Syntax:- select column_name from table1 left join table2 on table1.column=table2.column_name;
Select student.name, student.city, stud.age, from student left join stud on stud on student.id=stud.sid
3) Right Join
Right all
$) Full join and Unoin
Left join (union) right join
{Select * from student left join stud on student.id=stud.id

 select * from student right join stud on student.id=stud.id;}
Select column_name from table1 full outer join table2 on table1.column=table2.column
5) self join
Select column_name(s) from table1 T1, table2 T2 where condition
